SlideConnect WebRTC 2.0

Follow the following steps for proper installation:

1) download a free version of AdminLTE (for policy issues you cannot include AdminLTE files so you will find the adminlte folder empty which you will need to fill with the free download at the link: https://adminlte.io/)
2) Open the ReadMe folder, you will find the database and project schema.
3) The config/config.php file must be configured with your DB parameters.
4) also in the config/confg.php file you will need to enter the domain name or path you are using.

As of the current status of 10/01/2025, the WebRTC link has not been connected yet. it is only 24 hours since we started development. :)
